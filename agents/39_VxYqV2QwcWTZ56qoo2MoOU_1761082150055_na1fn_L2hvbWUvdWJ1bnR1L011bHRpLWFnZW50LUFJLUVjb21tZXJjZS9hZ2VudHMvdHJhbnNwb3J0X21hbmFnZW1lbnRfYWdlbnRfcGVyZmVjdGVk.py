Enhanced Transport Management Agent for E-commerce

This agent manages all aspects of shipping and transportation with integrated support for:
- European carrier API integrations (DPD, GLS, Hermes, Colissimo, Chronopost, etc.)
- Real-time label generation
- Route optimization
- Shipment tracking
- Carrier selection based on cost, speed, and reliability
- Contract-based pricing
- Performance monitoring

It provides a FastAPI interface for real-time operations and uses Kafka for asynchronous
communication with other agents in the multi-agent e-commerce system.
