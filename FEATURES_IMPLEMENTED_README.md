    product_id="tshirt-123",
    variant_attributes=["size", "color"],

**Purpose:** Implements the Saga pattern to ensure data consistency in distributed transactions.

**Key Features:**
-   **Distributed Transaction Management:** Coordinates multi-step workflows across different agents.
-   **Automatic Compensation:** If a step fails, the orchestrator automatically runs compensating actions to undo previous steps.
-   **Retry Logic:** Automatically retries failed steps with exponential backoff.
-   **Database Persistence:** Saga state is saved to the database for recovery.

**Example Saga Workflow (Order Creation):**
1.  **Reserve Inventory** (Inventory Agent)
    -   *Compensation: Release Inventory*
2.  **Process Payment** (Payment Agent)
    -   *Compensation: Refund Payment*
3.  **Create Order** (Order Agent)
    -   *Compensation: Cancel Order*

If `Process Payment` fails, the `Saga Orchestrator` will automatically call `Release Inventory` to ensure data consistency.
