## Agent Communication Patterns

### 1. Request-Response Pattern
**Use Case**: Synchronous operations requiring immediate response

**Example**: Order Agent requests payment from Payment Processing Agent
```
Order Agent → payment_requested → Payment Processing Agent
Payment Processing Agent → payment_completed → Order Agent
```

---

### 2. Event Notification Pattern
**Use Case**: Broadcasting state changes to multiple interested agents

**Example**: Order placed event triggers multiple agents
```
Order Agent → order_placed → [Inventory Agent, Notification Agent, Analytics Agent]
```

---

### 3. Saga Pattern
**Use Case**: Distributed transactions across multiple agents

**Example**: Order fulfillment saga
```
1. Order Agent → reserve_inventory → Inventory Agent
2. Inventory Agent → inventory_reserved → Order Agent
3. Order Agent → process_payment → Payment Processing Agent
4. Payment Processing Agent → payment_completed → Order Agent
5. Order Agent → allocate_warehouse → Warehouse Selection Agent
6. Warehouse Selection Agent → warehouse_allocated → Order Agent
7. Order Agent → select_carrier → Carrier Selection Agent
8. Carrier Selection Agent → carrier_selected → Order Agent
9. Order Agent → order_confirmed → Notification Agent
```

**Compensation**: If any step fails, compensating transactions are triggered

---

### 4. Event Sourcing Pattern
**Use Case**: Complete audit trail and state reconstruction

**Example**: Order lifecycle
```
All order state changes stored as events:
- OrderCreated
- PaymentProcessed
- InventoryReserved
- WarehouseAllocated
- ShipmentCreated
- OrderShipped
- OrderDelivered
```

---
