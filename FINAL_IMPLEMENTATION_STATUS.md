## Critical Gap Analysis

### Database Connectivity ⚠️

**Issue:** Most agents have stub database methods that return empty/mock data instead of persisting to PostgreSQL.

**Impact:**
- Agents can process business logic
- Agents CANNOT persist data
- Agents CANNOT retrieve historical data
- System loses state on restart

**Affected Agents:**
- `order_agent_production.py` - Methods return empty lists/UUIDs
- Most other agents have similar patterns

**Root Cause:**
- Shared database module exists and is excellent
- Agents are structured correctly (inherit from BaseAgent)
- Database methods are defined but not implemented
- Likely intentional for testing/development

**Solution Required:**
Replace stub methods like:
```python
async def get_orders_from_db(self, skip: int, limit: int) -> List[Dict]:
    logger.info(f"Getting orders: skip={skip}, limit={limit}")
    return []  # ❌ Stub
```

With real implementations like:
```python
async def get_orders_from_db(self, skip: int, limit: int) -> List[Dict]:
    async with self.db.get_session() as session:
        result = await session.execute(
            select(Order).offset(skip).limit(limit)
        )
        orders = result.scalars().all()
        return [order.to_dict() for order in orders]  # ✅ Real
```

**Effort Required:** 2-3 days to connect all database operations
