## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Integration Work

### 1. API Server

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION**

**What's Needed:**
- Create a unified FastAPI server that serves all endpoints the React dashboard expects
- Implement endpoints for:
  - Products (GET /api/products, POST /api/products, etc.)
  - Orders (GET /api/orders, POST /api/orders, etc.)
  - Customers (GET /api/customers, etc.)
  - Inventory (GET /api/inventory, etc.)
  - Warehouses (GET /api/warehouses, etc.)
  - Dashboard metrics (GET /api/metrics, etc.)
  - Agent status (GET /api/agents, etc.)

**Current State:**
- Individual agents have their own FastAPI apps
- No unified API gateway exists
- React dashboard cannot connect to backend

**Recommendation:**
Create `api/main.py` that:
1. Connects to PostgreSQL database
2. Implements all REST endpoints
3. Serves data to React dashboard
4. Runs on port 8000 or 8001

### 2. React Dashboard Configuration

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS API CONNECTION**

**What's Needed:**
- Update `multi-agent-dashboard/src/lib/api.js` to point to unified API
- Ensure all components fetch from real API instead of mock data
- Test all persona views (Merchant, Marketplace Operator, Admin)
- Verify real-time updates work

**Current State:**
- UI components are complete and styled
- API configuration exists but points to individual agent endpoints
- Mock data is used in some components

### 3. Agent Integration

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS TESTING**

**What's Needed:**
- Start all 26 agents using Docker Compose
- Verify inter-agent communication via Kafka
- Test complete workflows (order placement ‚Üí fulfillment ‚Üí delivery)
- Ensure new services integrate with existing agents

**Current State:**
- All agent code exists
- Docker Compose configuration exists
- Agents have not been started as a complete system
- New services exist but are not integrated into agent workflows

## üöÄ Steps to Production

### Phase 1: API Integration (Estimated: 4-6 hours)

1. **Create Unified API Server**
   ```bash
   # Create api/main.py with all endpoints
   # Connect to PostgreSQL
   # Implement CRUD operations
   ```

2. **Test API Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Start API server
   python3 api/main.py
   
   # Test endpoints
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/products
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/orders
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/customers
   ```

3. **Update React Dashboard**
   ```javascript
   // Update src/lib/api.js
   const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api';
   ```

### Phase 2: Full System Testing (Estimated: 2-4 hours)

1. **Launch Complete Stack**
   ```bash
   # Use the launch script
   ./launch.sh --dev
   
   # Or manually with Docker Compose
   cd infrastructure
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Verify All Services**
   - PostgreSQL: ‚úÖ Running
   - Redis: ‚úÖ Running
   - Kafka: ‚úÖ Running
   - API Server: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs to be started
   - All 26 Agents: ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to be started
   - React Dashboard: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs API connection

3. **Test Complete Workflows**
   - Customer places order ‚Üí Order Agent processes ‚Üí Inventory Agent reserves stock ‚Üí Warehouse Agent fulfills ‚Üí Shipping Agent delivers
   - Merchant adds product ‚Üí Product Agent creates ‚Üí Inventory Agent tracks
   - Admin monitors system ‚Üí All agents report status

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Estimated: 2-3 hours)

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set production environment variables
   - Configure external database (if not using local PostgreSQL)
   - Set up Redis cluster (if needed)
   - Configure Kafka cluster (if needed)

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Enable HTTPS/TLS
   - Implement authentication (JWT)
   - Set up API rate limiting
   - Configure CORS properly

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure logging (centralized logs)
   - Set up metrics collection (Prometheus/Grafana)
   - Configure alerting (email/Slack notifications)
