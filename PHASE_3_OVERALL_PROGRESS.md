## Integration Status

### Backend Integration

The merchant portal integrates with the multi-agent backend system through a centralized API gateway. Each functional area is supported by dedicated agents that handle business logic and data persistence.

**Active Agents:**

- Product Management Agent
- Order Management Agent
- Customer Management Agent
- Inventory Management Agent
- Warehouse Agent
- Returns Agent
- Campaign Agent
- Promotion Agent
- Review Agent
- Loyalty Agent

**Database Integration:**

All pages are integrated with the PostgreSQL database through the agent layer. Database schema includes tables for products, orders, customers, inventory, campaigns, promotions, reviews, loyalty points, and more.

---

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality

All pages follow consistent architectural patterns and coding standards. Components are modular, reusable, and well-documented. Error handling is comprehensive, and loading states are implemented throughout.

### Testing Status

- **Unit Testing:** Not yet implemented
- **Integration Testing:** Not yet implemented
- **Manual Testing:** Partial (pages created but not fully tested in browser)
- **E2E Testing:** Not yet implemented

### Recommended Testing Approach

1. **Manual Testing:** Test each page in the browser with real API endpoints
2. **Integration Testing:** Verify data flow between pages and API
3. **Unit Testing:** Add tests for complex business logic
4. **E2E Testing:** Automated testing of critical user flows

---

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

Pages are built with performance in mind using React Query for efficient data fetching and caching. However, performance testing has not been conducted yet.

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Code Splitting:** Implement route-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
2. **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load heavy components like charts and tables
3. **Image Optimization:** Optimize product images and assets
4. **API Optimization:** Implement pagination and infinite scroll for large datasets
5. **Caching Strategy:** Fine-tune React Query cache configuration

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures

- API authentication through centralized gateway
- Input validation on forms
- CSRF protection (assumed at API level)
- Secure communication over HTTPS

### Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement granular permissions for different merchant roles
2. **Audit Logging:** Track all merchant actions for compliance
3. **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
5. **Security Scanning:** Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment

- **Frontend:** Vite dev server on port 5174
- **Backend:** Multiple agent processes on various ports
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API Gateway:** Port 8100

### Production Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Frontend:** Static build deployed to CDN (Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3 + CloudFront)
2. **Backend:** Containerized agents deployed to Kubernetes or AWS ECS
3. **Database:** Managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure Database)
4. **API Gateway:** Load-balanced API gateway with auto-scaling
